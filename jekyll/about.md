Hiya!  I'm Asherah/Lia, a systems/embedded software engineer from Melbourne,
Australia.

Here's my slightly out-of-date
[r&eacute;sum&eacute;](https://f.hrzn.ee/kivikakk.pdf).  I'm available for
contracting; lately I've done post-incident security analysis, and
pre-acquisition due diligence whole codebase review.  Contact me at `ashe@`
this domain if you'd like to discuss anything!

<!-- awkward formatting because i really (don't) want certain line breaks at different breakpoints -->
I'm trans, autistic, plural, poly, furry, asexual[^frankly],
and am<nobr> </nobr>committed to nuanced and careful discussion about identity.  <nobr>I make</nobr> an effort to represent my whole self online.

I don't really use social media any more, but you can catch me on the [Zig
Discord](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community#discord) and
[Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/kivikakk).

My main pursuits at the moment include:

* [DDR](https://kivikakk.ee/2021/08/16/ddr-the-second/),
  [pop'n music](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/860320018666356747/889404347321036810/Popn.Music.full.1549248.jpg), and
  [beatmania IIDX](https://sp12.iidx.app/sheets/4791-2487/clear)
* uncovering autistic self-identity
* running!?

I also enjoy [motorcycling in the hills](/assets/kalorama.jpg) and birds.

[^frankly]: tbh some of these are the most boring aspects of my life, but representation is important and I have the privilege (and so to some extent, responsibility) of being able to live my life openly.
