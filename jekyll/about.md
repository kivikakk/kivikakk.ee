Hiya!  I'm Asherah/Lia, a systems/embedded software engineer from Melbourne,
Australia.

Here's my slightly out-of-date
[r&eacute;sum&eacute;](https://f.hrzn.ee/kivikakk.pdf).  I'm available for
contracting; lately I've done post-incident security analysis, and
pre-acquisition due diligence whole codebase review.  Contact me at `ashe@`
this domain if you'd like to discuss anything!

I make an effort to represent my whole self online.  I'm trans, plural,
furry, asexual[^frankly], and committed to nuanced and careful discussion about identity.  

I don't really use social media any more, but you can catch me on the [Zig
Discord](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community#discord) and
[Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/kameliya).

My main interests at the moment include:

* ARM and RISC-V architectures (see [Daintree](https://github.com/kivikakk/daintree))
* [Zig](https://ziglang.org)
* FPGA hardware development
* Getting better at DDR again!

I also enjoy [motorcycling in the hills](/assets/kalorama.jpg), [beatmania
IIDX](https://sp12.iidx.app/sheets/4791-2487/clear), and birds.

[^frankly]: Frankly, these are some of the most boring aspects of my life, but I hope others like me --- who might feel besieged by the world sometimes --- can take comfort knowing there's representation out there.  Reach out if you need to.
