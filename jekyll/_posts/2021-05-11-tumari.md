While doing our grocery shopping for the week, Mistress picked some recipes rather arbitrarily.

A nice looking bolognese (vegan), which required I go to the bottle shop after work to fetch a suitable wine for cooking.

I started cooking proper at 5.30pm; a slight pause to make up some parmesan (vegan), receive the grocery delivery, learn how to use a Swiss army knife’s corkscrew to open the bottle.

Turns out mincing half a kilo of mushrooms takes some time.

All told it’s quarter to 9pm and dinner is nearly done. I remarked to Miss how late it had gotten, and—perhaps to my surprise—she said, “next time you’ll be quicker!”
