["finding your submissive
self"](https://slaveshae.wordpress.com/2021/04/26/finding-your-submissive-self/)
by shae hits so hard it _hurts_.

Transcluding here for our future study and contemplation, emphases mine.  The
degree to which most of this is felt is unreal.

(The one exception is vis-à-vis degradation, but that's not something I feel an
acute absence of, but rather a questionmark regarding.  There's a big extent to
which I wonder how much I inhibit my own desires due to internalised shame ---
it's not something I feel on the surface, nor is it an emotionality most would
associate with our public personae.

So it's not that I don't desire degradation, or that I do; not that I don't
know shame, or that I do.  Just that I have no insight into it one way or
another.  What _does_ resonate in that part is reference to needing that which
I would protest to; indeed, one of my peak submission experiences so far was
one in which I was helplessly trying to object to what was happening, so much
so that my body was acting under its own will, trying to push away the
dominant; me, awkwardly trying to tell her that despite this, I wanted her to
continue.)

Do I know what I am?
