I'm fucking sick of feeling like I'm talking past everyone; like none of my words actually register.

I don't know if it's this pandemic or what, but so decreasingly do I get the impression anyone cares to actually see me, to communicate soul to soul, real living being to real living being. (My nestmate is a beautiful exception, but then that's why we've endured as we have.)

I've had it with lowering the bar. Fucking get on my level.
