Oh, oh

There is something strange inside my head  
Something turns and runs from me  
If I look back now what would I see there following?

Can I withstand it and make it through to the light?  
If I turn back now then this will always follow

There is something strong inside my heart  
Something deep, unwavering  
If I breathe in now then I can’t find that part of me

Can I demand it and make it last through the night?  
If I wake up now then I can’t find the future

Oh, oh  
Oh, one step forward, forward  
Oh, oh  
Oh, one step forward, forward

Oh, oh  
Oh, one step forward, forward

‘cause the fear will take me if I let it in  
I must not, I must not, I must not, I must not let it in  
And the light will make me if I reach the end  
I will go, I will go, I will go, until it shines again

‘cause the fear will take me if I let it in  
I must not, I must not, I must not, I must not let it in  
And the light will make me if I reach the end  
I will go, I will go, I will go, until it shines again

Oh, oh  
Oh, one step forward, forward  
Oh, oh  
Oh, one step forward, forward

Oh, oh
