I'm finding, more and more, that I discover things about myself in the process of serialising my consciousness into words.

and

It seems to me that, as long as I keep writing, keep the channel of my being open, keep making myself vulnerable (unto what? the world itself?), discovery will continue.

(And so it happens here; the first line originally came out as "[…] that I discover things about them […]", and I am not fully sure how to understand it, other than to accept that, while in many ways a merging of identities is at play in this acceptance of my submissive, slave-ish self, my reflexive knowledge still very much applies the lens of a third party.)
