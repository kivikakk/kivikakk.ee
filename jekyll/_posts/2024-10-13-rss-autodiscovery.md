It's come to my attention that some folks don't know my blog has an [RSS feed]!
This is kind of astonishing to me as it suggests people actually manually check
blogs for new posts sometimes?!

At any rate, it does, it's just not linked anywhere explicitly --- but it is
supported via [RSS autodiscovery], which I just kind of .. assumed everyone
used, relied on, knew about? But apparently not!

I guess I'll add a link, just in case. :)
