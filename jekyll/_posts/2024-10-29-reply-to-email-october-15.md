Hiya <3

Thank you very much for your email; it was really lovely to receive. (Markdown
ecosystem work is not very rewarding a lot of the time, lol :p)

But yeah â€” I don't think there's anything in particular you could do, and
that's quite OK! The thought by itself is enough, thank you :) Financially I'm
completely fine. So I hope you get that Clojure gig and get money to make your
own life even cooler! (Throwback to that time I wrote a
[Clojure impl in Ruby!][rouge])

Be well <3
