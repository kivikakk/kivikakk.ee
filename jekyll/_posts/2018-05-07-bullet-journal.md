There’s my diary on the desk. It didn’t start out that way; it was a bullet journal
originally. It’s a Moleskine, since those are the fancy diaries with the dotted grids suitable
for bullet journals. I think the covers are leather. Oh well. I bought this years ago. At a
guess it has .. 180, 200 pages? I’m up to page 158 right now. I number them myself. I’ve
only ever used two different types of pens in it, both made by the same Japanese pen
company, Zebra. I can’t say I know for sure why I’ve chosen that pen company as “my” pen
company, but I have.

It has a little tassel attached to it to use as a bookmark. I keep the current day
marked.

The paper is slightly yellowed, with a grid of light dots, maybe 8mm apart in both
directions. It’d probably be good for playing grid-based paper games, but that’s not what I
use it for. At a guess I’d say it was 70~80gsm. Good, strong paper, without being bulky.

For a while I maintained an index on the first page, in true bullet journal fashion, with
page references for months, and a yearly overview for each year as it happened, three
months to a page. Turns out that wasn’t actually useful to me. Likewise, it was purely a daily
todo list and short bullet points on things that happened in a given day, if I felt it was
exceptional enough to mark it.

The beginning was November 2016. I wasn’t doing too well then. “Diazepam helped
alot.” “Fucking chill.” “chill” “relax about life a little” “Feeling a bit underappreciated” (NB.
this was almost certainly the understatement of the year.) The tone is rarely positive, and
when it is, it feels fabricated. There’s a lot of self-reassurance that things will be okay, and
reminders to try to provide reassurance to my partner that things will be okay. “Panic attack
all morning.” “Didn’t get any work done.” Sometimes there’s an upturn. “Feel better as the
day has gone on.” Then there’s a downturn. “Last night she was very suicidal.”

If I jump 60 pages ahead, the tone has changed significantly. “Sun feels so good!!
aaaaaaaaaaa” “GOD I LOVE BUNNIES” “feeling pretty fine w/ new hair”. The style of the
journal has changed, and it is much more a diary. Short dot points of a day’s events give way
to entire pages of solid prose, feelings I can now express.

Further months pass and days wax and wane, grow thicker and thinner. Sometimes
it’s thin because I’m too busy to write, other times because I’m too depressed to. Sometimes
it’s thick because I have too many negative emotions, other times too many positive events to
detail.

A lot happens in 158 pages.
