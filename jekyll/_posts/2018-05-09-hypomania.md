hypomania: “a mood state characterized by persistent disinhibition and elevation
(euphoria). […] According to DSM-5 criteria, hypomania is distinct from mania in that there
is no significant functional impairment; mania, by DSM-5 definition, does include significant
functional impairment and may have psychotic features.”

this is kinda a thing that keeps occurring to me on and off, as you’re aware. i wanted
to try to describe the subjective experience. because it’s a mood state defined by a set of
symptoms, i’ll do so according to the list of criteria.

pressured speech: i’m fucking talkative lately. i can’t stop expressing myself. i tweet a
lot and i talk a lot, but inside my head when i’m alone it’s like a freight train. the thing is, it
feels good. it feels like i’m putting together some unified theory of the world and psyche and
essentially every damn thing i’m talking about, like it All Makes Sense™. the desire to keep
talking and theorising is fuelled by this sense that i’m making sense of things, and that if i
keep doing so, i’ll have made sense of everything.

inflated self-esteem or grandiosity: my self-image is really good lately. this isn’t a bad
thing in itself, but it contrasts to my baseline of “this is fine”. i feel much more associated
with my body, much more accepting of it, and i’m much more willing to express the idea that
i’m good or even excellent at certain tasks. similarly, i have less qualms with putting myself
out there.

decreased need for sleep: this is pretty simple. lately i’ve not been tired, have had
trouble falling asleep if i’ve gone to bed early (e.g. with you), and still not been tired in the
morning when i wake up.

flight of ideas or the subjective experience that thoughts are racing: see ‘pressured
speech’. it feels like everything is related.

easily distracted and attention-deficit: this one hasn’t hit me as much, subjectively,
though i have struggled to accomplish much work-wise lately.

increase in psychomotor agitation, or occasionally in some, increased irritability:
maybe.

hypersexuality: from ace to 8 hours of fucking in 48 hours. yeah.

involvement in pleasurable activities that may have a high potential for negative
psycho-social or physical consequences: yes. there’s the whole 8 hours of sex with someone
you just met thing, but i’m willing to excuse that as simply queer life sometimes. but we
didn’t use any protection! hello disinhibition. :/

i need “elevated mood” plus three of those for the DSM-IV-TR definition. i have
elevated mood plus six, so ...
