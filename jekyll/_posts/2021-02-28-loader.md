title: Knowing when to look past your code
---

There's a weird tension in programming --- on the one hand, as you learn the
ropes, you (hopefully) learn very quickly that the problem is almost _always_
in your code, and not, say, the compiler, stdlib, kernel, etc.  This is usually
very correct; the people who've worked on those things have many times the
experience you did when you decided that there must be a bug in `printf` or
something.

You'll later realise you tried to print something through a pointer to a
stack-allocated variable that's long since gone.  These accusations tend to
wane as you gain familiarity with your subject matter, and wax as you step out
into lands populated with ever more footguns, exposing more of the architecture
than you ever suspected was there.  (See also: the emails from me to the libev
mailing list in 2011.)

At some point, though, your journies will take you to places where things
aren't so clear cut, and you'll start to gain a sixth sense; a kind of visceral
experience that _things are not as they have been promised to be_.

<a id="more"></a>A few weeks ago, that sixth sense whispered in my ear: "what
if, instead of your cruddy bootloader written in a pre-1.0 systems language for
a platform you don't fully understand, it's the 20 year-old project with 80,000
commits that's wrong?"  And it was right.

[Daintree](https://github.com/kivikakk/daintree)'s bootloader, dainboot, worked
great on QEMU, but would fail hard and fast on hardware with synchronous
aborts.  It's a UEFI application, which means we get a lot for free -- see how
easy it is to [search connected FAT filesystems for
binaries](https://github.com/kivikakk/daintree/blob/c8ecf0131aba16fb6ef1991393b7088037526f77/dainboot/src/dainboot.zig#L98-L160).
I don't particularly want to spend much effort on a bootloader, so this makes
sense to me.

QEMU comes bundled with a build of [TianoCore EDK2](https://www.tianocore.org),
which makes it really easy to get started.  On my ROCKPro64 I have a build of
[U-Boot](https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot) installed to the eMMC, an extremely
versatile bootloader found on all kinds of devices[^why-no-edk2-on-rk].  It
makes a TFTP-based development cycle remarkably pleasant.

But different bootloaders mean very different execution environments.  For one,
EDK2 seems to execute the UEFI application in EL1, whereas U-Boot gives over
control in EL2.  There are many, many differences in the state of the various
system control registers.  And in this case, right in the beginning, we were
getting an exception in U-Boot before we'd done barely any work:

```

           '/efi\boot\BOOTAA64.efi'
```

The disassembly showed that at `pc=0xd98` in the image we were attempting to
load a byte from the address pointed to by register `x9`:

```
d98: 2b 01 40 39                   ldrb    w11, [x9]
```

In the register dump, `x9` has the value `0000000000003b5c`, whereas we are
clearly relocated much higher in memory (note the UEFI image offset; the `pc`
is relative to that).  Should `x9` actually have a higher computed address?  I
hacked some things together to get a register dump from a similar place in QEMU
(on EDK2, where this all worked):

I've highlighted `x9` -- it has a value that's clearly much more
valid-pointer-looking, and it even ends in `...b5c`, which makes me think it's
a corrected version of the `3b5c` value we saw on the ROCKPro64.

What could cause a register to have a correct-looking address on one platform
but not on the other?  Let's look at the code up and until the point where
things fall apart.  Unfortunately, UEFI code objects are all
[COFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFF)s.  I'm super inexperienced with
these, and so too it turns out is the tooling in the area; I think it must be a
bit of a hack that Zig or LLVM knows how to produce them, because it also
produces a [PDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_database) alongside that
presumably contains the debugging/line info, but then `llvm-objdump` refuses to
use the same thing, helpfully declaring:

```
llvm-objdump: warning: 'dainboot/zig-cache/bin/BOOTAA64.
rockpro64.efi': failed to parse debug information for
dainboot/zig-cache/bin/BOOTAA64.rockpro64.efi
```

![Hand-written disassembly.](/assets/post-img/disas.jpg)

(The right-hand page has the disassembly in reverse, since we only have the
state of registers at the point in time of the last instruction and have to
trace data dependencies backwards.  The precise values are different because
they shifted every time I added some breaks or debugging helpers anywhere.)

I have no line numbers -- it's up to disassembly and guesswork.  Here's the
former:

```
d8c: 09 01 40 f9                   ldr     x9, [x8]
d90: ea 07 40 f9                   ldr     x10, [sp, #8]
d94: 29 01 0a 8b                   add     x9, x9, x10
d98: 2b 01 40 39                   ldrb    w11, [x9]
```

I've grown very fond of aarch64 (dis)assembly.  Look at those four-byte
instructions.  This experience was a crash course in learning it.

So what have we here?  Translated into pseudo-C:

* The faulting instruction tries to load a byte from the address stored in
  `x9`, which we know to be `00003b5c`, i.e. `w11 = *(u8 *)x9`.
* `x9` was calculated as `x9 = x9 + x10`.
* `x10` came from `x10 = *(sp + 8)`.
* `x9` came from `x9 = *x8`.

At first I thought that `x10` must've been some relocation base, but it's zero
on both QEMU and hardware.  The pointer is whatever we get from `x8`, which is
`0000000078f0ab78` on hardware and `0x5c1f5b78` on QEMU.  The last few digits
line up nicely, again, so it looks like whatever's at that address is a
relocated address on QEMU/EDK2 but just _not_ on ROCKPro64/U-Boot.  What even
is at that address?  Let's look at the symbol table.

U-Boot told us in the exception dump that the UEFI image was loaded at
`0x78f07000`, so `0x78f0ab78` is at offset `0x3b78` from the start of the
image.  What's that?  `objdump` to the rescue.  It's in our `.data` section:

```
3b70 287b737d 290d0a00 5c3b0000 00000000  ({s})...........
```

I really had to squint at this for a moment before realising that `0x3b78`
actually contains a 64-bit pointer value, `0x00000000003b5c` --- in other
words, the exact value of `x8` we saw!  So this was pulled directly out of the
loaded image.  Two questions arose: what _is_ it?  And how is it that QEMU/EDK2
got something different here?

It felt off that it should point to a value directly before itself in memory.
Here's context:

```
3b50 02200000 00000000 00000000 6461696e  ............dain
3b60 74726565 20626f6f 746c6f61 64657220  tree bootloader 
3b70 287b737d 290d0a00 5c3b0000 00000000  ({s})...........
```

A string!  `0x3b78` points to `0x3b5c`, which is the greeting string printed
from the bootloader.  Why this indirection in the binary itself?

There are three sections in the PE/COFF files generated by the build process:
`.text`, which contains the executable code, `.data`, which contains strings
and other bits, and `.reloc`.  It still felt like this was a relocation issue,
so I read Microsoft's [PE
Format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format)
documentation carefully.  `objdump` was doing a lot of the heavy lifting for
us, but to really understand it, I wanted to [pull apart the format
myself](https://github.com/kivikakk/daintree/blob/master/tools/pe-parser.rb).
This approach would turn out to be invaluable.

The PE relocation section is comprised of a number of base relocation blocks,
which defines a 32-bit base address for the block, each with any number of
entries that specify the type of relocation and the 12-bit offset in that block
to apply it at.  Here's a decoded `.reloc` we got:

```
Page RVA: 0xa000
28 relocations:
  0xaca8 0xacb8 0xacc8 0xacd8 0xace8 0xacf8 0xad08 0xad18

  0xbd70 0xbdc0 0xbe18 0xbe68 0xbea8
```

`objdump` couldn't give us this!  (The addresses don't line up with the above
because I continued to hack on and modify things, shifting everything in the
binary around.  This was as frustrating as it might seem.  These lined up
exactly with the indirection seen above.)

For my purposes, I ignore all entries except of the type
`IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64`: "The base relocation applies the difference to the
64-bit field at offset."  It turns out Zig/LLVM only generates those, and they
work as simply as they sound: at the address specified by the relocation entry,
treat it as a 64-bit field and add the relocation offset to it.

So, a PE loader should, after loading all data, visit all those addresses and
add the relocation offset to them.  It seemed like that was happening correctly
on QEMU/EDK2 --- when we loaded the addresses, they had been shifted for us.
But why not on U-Boot?

To answer this, I looked at the U-Boot source code.  And when looking wasn't
enough, it was time to `printf` debug, which meant getting a U-Boot build that
actually ran on my hardware.  There's a 4+ hour gap between the two blocks of
chat here:

!["finally got my own uboot build running!! fuck"](/assets/post-img/fuck.png)

(I nuked the boot environment quite a few times getting to this point.)

`printf` debugging to the rescue: U-Boot wasn't doing any of the relocations,
at all.  It thought there weren't any:

```
doing relocations (rel 0x0000000078efb2e0 rel_size 0x68
                   efi_reloc 0x0000000078ef6000
                   image_base 0x0)
DAINDBG: delta: 0x78ef6000
rel: 0x0000000078efb2e0, end: 0x0000000078efb348,
     rel->SizeOfBlock: 0x0
DAINDBG: done
```

`rel->SizeOfBlock` here corresponds to the [Block
Size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#base-relocation-block)
field in the base relocation block.  My tools were clearly showing that block
had a very non-zero size, so how was U-Boot getting a different idea?

I tried dumping the table raw, 32 bytes as hex to see what we got, and it was
all zero.  Something was still up.  I had to keep going back.

!["so now i need to suspect the code immediately
before"](/assets/post-img/suspect.png)

I riddled the loader with `printf`s:

```
DAINDBG: loading section[2]: VA 0x0000000078efb2e0 --
    setting 0x68 bytes to zero, then loading 0x200 bytes
    from 0x0000000002085600
    (efi 0x0000000002080000 + PointerToRawData 0x5600)
DAINDBG: loading section[1]: VA 0x0000000078ef9860 --

    (efi 0x0000000002080000 + PointerToRawData 0x200)
```

Here's the code that corresponds to the above, with the `printf`
re-approximated post-hoc for your reading pleasure:

```c
/* Load sections into RAM */
for (i = num_sections - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
	/* XXX */
	printf("DAINDBG: loading section[%d]: VA %p -- "
	       "setting 0x%x bytes to zero, then loading "
	       "0x%x bytes from %p (efi %p + "
	       "PointerToRawData %x)\n", 
	       i,
	       efi_reloc + sec->VirtualAddress,
	       sec->Misc.VirtualSize,
	       sec->SizeOfRawData,
	       efi + sec->PointerToRawData,
	       efi,
	       sec->PointerToRawData);
	/* XXX */
	IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER *sec = &sections[i];
	memset(efi_reloc + sec->VirtualAddress, 0,
	       sec->Misc.VirtualSize);
	memcpy(efi_reloc + sec->VirtualAddress,
	       efi + sec->PointerToRawData,
	       sec->SizeOfRawData);
}
```

Firstly, we load them in reverse.  Weird, but okay.  Secondly, it became clear
that `section[1]` (`.data`) overlaps `section[2]` (`.reloc`) by 384 bytes (!!):

1. `.reloc`: load at `0x78efb2e0`, zero `0x68` bytes at start, then load
   `0x200` bytes at start, until `0x78efb4e0` non-incl.
2. `.data`: load at `0x78ef9860`, zero `0x1a75` bytes at start, then load
   `0x1c00` bytes at start, until `0x78efb460` non-incl. (**`0x180` bytes into
   `.reloc` target !!**)
3. `.text`: load at `0x78ef6200`, zero `0x364c` bytes at start, then load
   `0x3800` bytes at start, until `0x78ef9a00` non-incl. (**`0x1a0` bytes into
   `.data` target !!**)

Oh boy.  I didn't even notice until now that the `.text` overlapped `.data` too.
Who _knows_ what would've happened if the sections aligned such that the
relocations worked.  It would've been much harder to diagnose.

Why would this happen?  It seems like `VirtualAddress + SizeOfRawData` overlaps
with other `VirtualAddress`es.  What does the [PE
format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#section-table-section-headers)
say about `VirtualAddress`?

`SizeOfRawData` is below it and caught my eye.  Emphasis mine:

`SizeOfRawData` is rounded to a multiple of `FileAlignment`, which the docs
tell us is typically 512 bytes.  (Notice they all divide by `0x200`.)  But
that's presumably just because of the way they align in the file!  What _is_
`VirtualSize`, which until now we're only using to determine how much to zero?

The **total size**.  It seems pretty clear that we should never load more than
this many bytes, even if `SizeOfRawData` happens to be bigger.  The size of the
section can't be bigger than this.  If we were to constrain our `memcpy`s to
`min(VirtualSize, SizeOfRawData)`, we get this instead:

1. `.reloc`: load at `0x78efb2e0`, zero `0x68` bytes at start, then load
   ~~`0x200`~~ **`0x68`** bytes at start, until **`0x78efb348`** non-incl.
2. `.data`: load at `0x78ef9860`, zero `0x1a75` bytes at start, then load
   ~~`0x1c00`~~ **`0x1a75`** bytes at start, until **`0x78efb2d5`** non-incl.
   (**before `.reloc` begins**)
3. `.text`: load at `0x78ef6200`, zero `0x364c` bytes at start, then load
   ~~`0x3800`~~ **`0x364c`** bytes at start, until **`0x78ef984c`** non-incl.
   (**before `.data` begins**)

It looked like a bug.  If U-Boot loaded sections forwards, this wouldn't have
been exposed, but either way it appeared to be an error to do this at all.  The
section shouldn't be loaded beyond its VirtualSize.

A quick trip to the [EDK2 PE
loader](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/c640186ec8aae6164123ee38de6409aed69eab12/BaseTools/Source/C/Common/BasePeCoff.c#L1028-L1031)
shows they load at most `min(VirtualSize, SizeOfRawData)` bytes into memory,
and then pad up to `VirtualSize` with zeroes if needed.  (The zeroing behaviour
is for BSS-style initialisation.)  They never touch memory past `VirtualSize`
bytes.

```diff
 memcpy(efi_reloc + sec->VirtualAddress,
        efi + sec->PointerToRawData,
-       sec->SizeOfRawData);
+       min(sec->Misc.VirtualSize, sec->SizeOfRawData));
```

[One short conversation
later](http://u-boot.10912.n7.nabble.com/Re-PATCH-efi-loader-don-t-load-beyond-VirtualSize-td440790.html#a440833),
and [the bug was
fixed](https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/commit/9d30a941cce5ed055da18398f4deba18830d00d6).

(This is what success looks like.)

_Sometimes_, the problem is not in your code.

[^why-no-edk2-on-rk]:
    Maybe it'd be nice if I could slap EDK2 on the ROCKPro64 --
    [edk2-porting/edk2-rk3399](https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk3399)
    appears to be the strongest effort in this area so far, and it doesn't look
    great.  U-Boot is mature on many embedded platforms.
