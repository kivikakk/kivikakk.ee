Today’s been hard. My autistic tendencies have flared up — perhaps from
overworking myself these past few days — and made communication with Miss I.
difficult.

We cleared up heavy matters in the afternoon, but this evening I started to find

Putting one hand on my knee and looking straight at me, she got my attention and
said plainly: “I ban you from speaking.”

For the next ten minutes, I felt my mind slowly unspool.
