title: "Literate pickle"
---

I've been deleting hundreds of accounts and cleaning up many more while
preparing for the move, and I found I have an npm account with one (1)
package, last published May 2012 (!): [allium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/allium),
a parser for the ["Gherkin" syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)#Gherkin_language)
used to define Cucumber BDD tests, back when that was all the rage.

The README captured by npm refers to the literate source code as once published
on GitHub Pages. That was long ago, but I figured it might be fun to look at
again. And it is! Have look: <https://f.hrzn.ee/allium/>
