Yesterday was our 100th day in Estonia. Taking a little bit of stock of what we've managed:

* Visited the 4 largest cities in the country.
* Rented an apartment in the biggest one!
* Furnished what the apartment didn't come with.
* Shipped our things from Australia. (Maybe a month off those arriving.)
* Got our motorcycles; put 900km on each.
* Got medium-term visa for A, and long-term one applied for.
* Got our medications prescribed locally.
* Financial/bureaucratic overhead.
* Changed my name and got new ID.
* Got onto a good family doctor's list.
* Kept in touch with families and psychologists.
* Vaccinations.
* Saw the border.
* Went to a cat café.
* Went to sauna.
* Concluded jaanipäev with clothes smelling deeply of bonfire.
* Went to a live show (Estonian).
* Went to a live show (non-Estonian).
* Walked about 500km.
* Taken a lot of public transport.
* Met a range of people.
* Spoken quite a bit of Estonian.
* Kept up with projects.
* Finished a diary!
* Grew a lot.
