flashes: end

Quoting “(un)monitored”:

> I have no idea if anyone reads this. It _is_ linked from one of our blogs, but you have to look to even find that blog, let alone notice the link. […] On the other hand, *because* of this, I am able to write more openly. If I knew I had any kind of readership at all, I might not write some things, or might write differently. 

Unfortunately, the spell was broken; the wave function collapsed; the superposition observed; the duality reduced to one.  This girl always worked better in the in-betweens.

A reader reached out and, though I was extremely flattered at first, now I can’t feel the same way about writing here.

I was never meant to be someone in your story—I was meant to be an exhibit of open life, to be appreciated, not touched.

Godspeed.
