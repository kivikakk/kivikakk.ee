Here's a little tool I've made to help my partner and I while learning Estonian.
Very much nothing special, but I'll hopefully find more resources to add to it
over time!

(Previously on this topic: [Estonian Morphology Guide
(mirror)](https://kivikakk.ee/estonian/2016/04/18/estonian-morphology-guide-mirror.html).
I no longer collect analytics on my site, but when I did it was consistently one
of the most-visited parts of it, presumably because the link broke at some
point. I've just found its new canonical home, though, so I've updated the
link!)
