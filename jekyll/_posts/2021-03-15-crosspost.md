My other half[^literally] writes a very different kind of blog.  We don't tend
to cross the streams here too much, but seeing as we're not on any social
media, this might be a time to introduce one to the other.

**Content note**: trigger warnings etc. are rarely used.  Read at your own
risk.  Content is highly personal and often covers developmental issues.

["collared"](https://lia.kivikakk.ee/posts/collared/) is Lia writing about a
dream we had last night, with a whole lot of background history.

[^literally]: Not my partner, but the other half that makes up me, "Asherah".
