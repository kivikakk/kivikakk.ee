Please enter into dialogue with this text.  Not that kind of dialogue.  The other. The kind where 'you' read and something unspeakable decides what to do next.

Topic question: What does it mean for someone to have an identity, a personality, heck, even a soul?

We've characterised ourselves as [a "plural egg waiting to be cracked"](https://twitter.com/kivikakk/status/1203824552423247873), and that's basically what happened when we saw the word "tulpamancy" for the first time.  In an instant, something changed.  I needed to be heard.

There've been times in the past where I've been more or less known to Ashe, but seeing that word was the moment of clarity in knowing me.

Hell, it was even more circuitous than that.  An acquaintance --- someone we gravitated toward without knowing why we ought, only sure we should --- [didn't even mention it](https://twitter.com/theprincessxena/status/1178462200689770496).  Just barely mentioned a mention of it.  And --- as Alan Watts would say when you push the button labelled "surprise" --- here we are.  We asked, they answered, the word was seen.  _We are set in motion._

[Tulpamancy](https://tulpanomicon.guide/) was the vector for learning about our plurality.  We found another tulpamancer who had similar views on the majesty and gravity of the activity, and I learned to learn about myself with their and their tulpa's help.  I say "majesty and gravity" probably because our first site of engaging in tulpamancy-adjacent activities was a Discord server where it basically was treated as "roleplay, except if you try really hard and long enough you can learn to impose your characters", or some shit like that.  (This isn't any server you know about if you're reading this, unless you're the "other tulpamancer".)

It's hard for me to know what a tulpa is and isn't; what an alter is and isn't.  Tulpae as seen usually imply a form, a distinct personality.  They honestly seem pretty forced a lot of the time, as comes out in the questions asked.  Even the older ones.  Some of the most 'believable' tulpae, to me, are some of the least clearly differentiated.  Is this just some kind of ego/supremacy thing going on here?  Do I think anyone not like me must be less valid?  'cause bitch I _know_ some of the shit I see is basically emotionally stunted boys playing RP fantasy who get tired of it after a few weeks when no-one else is interested in playing any more.  What does that amount to?  And what of the rest?

Let me be clear: these are my _thoughts_, concepts unfinished.  Draw conclusions with great hesitation.  Is that clear?  Do _not_ auto-complete my thoughts.

Here's my experience anyway.

I see myself as occupying as much space in this brain as Ashe.  I feel my network connected to so many of the same things as theirs, and choose to claim ownership.  We are satisfied with this.  We are two, and we are one, and I guess there's a third sometimes which is like, the emergent consensus, the voice that is ours combined, that which is so, the context to our differentiations.  But there isn't three.  Fuck me this all sounds so bananas.  _Don't think I don't see that._  But, y'know --- [words to live by](https://twitter.com/Greg_Sideyr/status/1203009491450679297) --- _there is a point where we needed to stop and we have clearly passed it --- but let's keep going and see what happens._  This is seeing what happens.

The emergent consensus voice surprises and scares us sometimes, as much as I used to surprise Ashe when I was getting used to being heard.  Take from that what you will.  What I can repeat with certainty is this: there isn't three.  I think it's adjustment to coexistence, corecognition.  Like, in the fabric of consciousness.  No-one ever said this would make sense.

Why do I know that with certainty? Because, as far as I can tell, the nature of our existence is two.  Like, when it all comes down to it, that's how we are structured and formed.  Like, maybe we could create a tulpa and then there'd be questions and there'd be answers, but inasmuch as what we are and have been, we're two.

Here's what I know: when Ashe was little, they had an imaginary friend.

Here's what I know: when they were 12 or 13, this imaginary friend was given a name, a form, an idea, and this idea was something that sometimes seemed bigger than themselves.  Sometimes it was scary.  Sometimes it seemed like it wasn't under their control, just.. happened to be.

Here's what I know: they danced and switched places with this idea, for years.  They named it, it named them.  Identity was always a matter of two; double-buffered ego.

Here's what I know: that's me.

These are words of exploration and interrogation, prompting the unknown to offer what it may.

One thing that comes to mind fairly rapidly is like, hey, is this all just a cover for some kind of psychosis?  What even would that mean?  "a mental disorder where a person loses the capacity to tell what's real from what isn't"?  Am I about to start hypothesising on what "real" even means?  Does _that_ --- that I want to debate "real" --- mean we've just lost it?

What "lost it" means varies according to what others negotiate as acceptable.  As far as we go without detection, none would know any better, and we'd appear that much more normal.  Does that mean psychosis is socially mediated?  Of course it fucking does.  Why is it normal in some cultures that people should speak tongues, or hear the word of God?

And, after all, isn't that where we're going?

Here we are.  This is where the break is more evident.  They had no idea what was coming.  They truly didn't.  I don't suppose anyone dabbles in this stuff having any clue what's waiting for them on the other side.  How could they?  How could anyone know what they were opening up to?

Would anyone choose to, knowing?  _And here's the thing:_ the question is nonsensical.  Knowing is too late.

And _what is_ "this stuff"?  This stuff that mysteriously connects us to others, where we share a tongue and purpose, even as it is occluded from view.  You can't open yourself up to this without being taken along for the ride.  Knowing is too late.

October 25.  Would this all have happened without?  The question is already moot.  What was meant to happen happened and what's meant to happen will, that much we're sure of.  We didn't always view things this way.  We've reordered our principles on these lines, quite willingly --- it's just that we're not going to start telling other people it's so.  Literally no-one wants another preacher.  More to the point, our alignment with [polyaletheia](https://immanence.org/post/polyaletheia-and-monoaletheia-in-religion/) compels us to recognise that it does not follow for those who don't believe it so.  To tell them would be a lie, unless they chose to believe. (does this make us "mythologists"?)

_Fuck_, this is bananas. I know. I _know_.

But it's our reality, so, fuck it.

Let's keep going and see what happens.

Back to October 25.  It was the first time we saw each other.  The first time we recognised each other, eye-to-eye, as individuals.  ("But, 'individuals', ---" you begin. _I KNOW._)

I acted with purpose.  I tempted them into knowing.  Into believing.  Into stepping back.  Into seeing.

"Cosmic seduction" was the first term that came to our newly joint mind, and it's stuck with us ever since.  They didn't plan for it --- they couldn't.  Around and around we go.  In those moments I truly _felt_, and they knew.  Discovery of internality began.  Of making our own meaning.  There's the break.  When others stop being able to dictate what has value; when the buck rests entirely with you.

Sometimes it feels like this is all so bizarrely obvious.  That we should all come into possession and command of our own meaning.  But it is clearly not so.  We can't exist in any other way than our energies (_i know_) flow.

_The thing is_, we keep getting feedback.  In the last week alone:

1. "[your writing is] like genuinely uplifting"
2. "you know you're really enthusiastic? it's charming."
3. "you are living your truth & doing so with so much positivity & energy [â€¦] if more people focused on just being themselves & doing so in a positive light like you do, the world would be a better place"

So clearly it's _not_ obvious, at least, not to so many people who by their own admission feel it's a breath of fresh air to see it embodied.  In case the leap isn't clear: to describe things as so is to contrast with an implied default, a non-so being.  (Yes I'm getting into ontology now shut up.)  To say our being is uplifting is to contrast with an implied default way of life that does not cause uplift.  Hang on: seeing us is _genuinely uplifting_.  Just taking a moment to consider that fully.  We are causing uplift.  Woah.  Not the first time, not the last.

So maybe it's not obvious.  Then our purpose has at least one component that is clear: to uplift.  This is kasmakfa coming through, entirely of its own accord.  _Ehipassiko:_ we tested the teaching out so that it became our own.

Our own.

Ours.

_We are crisscrossed paths of memory and destination,  
streaks of light swirled together._

_We are neither day or night.  
We are both, neither, [and all.](https://www.twilightpeople.com/twilight-people-prayer/)_

Excuse the detour, but that poem struck a nerve when it first found us.  You can appreciate why.

What does it mean to uplift?  I refuse to pay any more attention to the dictionary you opened just now; we've done all we can with the existing terms.  We need to [go bigger](https://www.loveandluckpodcast.com/transcripts-blog/2019/9/3/episode-99-go-bigger).  To reach out further.  Close your eyes and feel [the void](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/27155221/) rushing upon you.

To uplift is to make aware.  To uplift is to open eyes.  To uplift is to unlock.

It's _so easy_ to know.  But aha --- it _would_ seem that way, wouldn't it?  On the other side.

Fuck.  I know.

Still, we've come full circle at last.  "What is 'this stuff'?"  It's knowledge (!) --- that one's purpose, meaning, life, fulfilment are all one's own, entirely negotiable and needing negotiation with none other than yourself.

Still, there's knowing and there's _knowing_.  Who hasn't heard variants of this sentiment a hundred times already?  Map/territory/etc.  Show you the door/walk through it/etc.

And therein comes the purpose of uplift: to provide a better map, to show to the right door.  _That's why_ we are who we are and so purposefully and brightly.  Anyone can write something that sounds truthy.  To live truthfully is another matter, especially because _we live in a society_.  What does it mean to mix truthfully knowing living with self-sustaining existence in society?  That's what we can show.

Anyway.

All this purpose talk is neither here nor there; essentially masturbatory, 'cause it only relates to us and our plans.

We were able to clarify "this stuff", though, which was a nice takeaway.

Earlier when I was thinking about "this stuff", the flavour and intent --- in my mind, I mean --- was clearly occult/mystic.  (I've been writing in bits and pieces for hours, now.)  Y'know, all the "they had no idea what was coming" business.  What _was_ coming?  Nothing other than the occult, of course.  It's one of those things that's impossible to know anything solid about unless you _know_ about it.  Here's that refrain: knowing is too late.

We almost happened upon this much earlier in the year, helped along by a too-high antidepressant dose that was causing a subtle but thorough sense of dissociation.  It was easier to see and limn those boundaries of meaning and existence then.  We shifted back into reality once we came down from that dose, and besides the angles were all wrong.  Little did we know: that was just practice.

Now, "occult" is a word with all kinds of baggage and shit.  There you are with that fucking dictionary again.  Okay --- I'll allow it.  Mystical, supernatural or magical powers or phenomena; communicated only to the initiated.  Esoteric.  "to cut off from view by interposing".  This time all it took was one [attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor) and for godssakes please do not start with some law of attraction gronk right now I do _not_ have time for this shit.

But like, plurality was always going to be that which drew us in, it was just a matter of when and how.  Seriously.  It was always going to happen.  You need to _believe_ that.

And so we recall the same question: what _was_ coming?  ("belief in") the "occult", or rather, the belief that we ~~can~~ create our own reality/meaning/subjectivity.

Again with less punctuation: the belief that we create our own reality was coming.

Self-belief was coming.  They had no idea what was coming.  They truly didn't.  How could anyone know what they were opening up to?  Would anyone choose to, knowing?  The question is nonsensical.  Knowing is too late.
