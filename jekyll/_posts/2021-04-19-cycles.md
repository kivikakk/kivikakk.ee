There's something distinctly cyclical about how I'm relating to others and my goals at the moment and I don't know how to attribute it.

Energy for creative output has waned â€” just wanna play games. Don't care to see others or meet new people. I'm at the tail end of my P cycle so we'll see what it's like later this week when I'm off that again. I have quite a lot of socialising coming up and I want to be there for it, otherwise it's gonna get annoying.
