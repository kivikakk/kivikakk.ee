### it happened during the movie

yes no, yes no, yes no  
a cat’s eye is the signal

yes no, yes no, yes no  
I’m not witty enough

mix the whites together  
with your finger

turning, smoothly, around

spell it out for me, what they speak  
because I want to read it  
like a novel

give up / your eyes were diverted  
do you hate me?  hate this, that, everyone?  right;  
you think it’s fine if  
everyone gets fucked up eventually  
don’t you?

blue  
stamp it “par avion”

the roar of the waves at night  
you and me  
running, laughing

not with you, not without you

the cheese of a pessimist

bite me  
hurt me  
if the memories flow

play the fool; a sad clown  
tears all a lie  
why?

i miss you

i want to meet soon  
but my eyes are getting in the way

good night

cry  
somehow  
take a breath

i’m sorry

i will grant you anything  
i will caress you softly  
call my name, and  
close your eyes  
just close your eyes

like this, let’s go far far away  
and paint the sky red  
so please, don’t  
tell me it was all just a dream  
is this farewell?  
everything seems just like in a cinema  
yet realistic at the same time too

happy like this, i’m by your side  
it’s not that kind of ending, y’know?
